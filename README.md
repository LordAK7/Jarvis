# Jarvis
Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

# Why?

@ I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1.It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).

2.Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.

# Whem contributing to this reprository keep in mined the following:

1.Dont forget to add commrnts to the code.
2.If its a bug code split it into multiple files as we want to keep it fast.

# The Future of This project is 

1.I want to keep it fast
2.In future after all the base code is written we will try to convert this in real A.i using artificial inteligence, machine learning .deep learning .
