# Jarvis
Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

# Why?

@ I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1.It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).

2.Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.

# Jarvis Mark 1 - The base system 

It can do a lot of cool things, some of them being:

- open website 
- image search
- google search
- tell temperature of any location
- play music

# Jarvis Mark 2 - Adding 30 usefull features (under devlopment)

Features to be addded

- Greet user
- Tell current time and date
- Launch applications/softwares 
- Open location of any place plus tells the distance between your place and queried place 
- Can play any song on YouTube
- Tells top headlines (via Times of India)
- Send email (with subject and content)
- Calculate any mathematical expression (example: Jarvis, calculate x + 135 - 234 = 345)
- Answer any generic question (via Wolframalpha)
- Take important note in notepad
- Tells a random joke
- Can switch the window
- Can take screenshot and save it with custom filename
- Can hide all files in a folder and also make them visible again


# Jarvis Mark 4 - Adding more usefull features (future)

Features to be addded

- interfacing arduino sensor control
- Dht11 sesnor and soil moisture sensor input (it will say termperature from temperature sensor in ur room)

# Jarvis Mark 3 - Adding more usefull features (future)

Features to be addded

- Machine learning consept
- Deep learning consept
- face recognation
- opencv 

# When contributing to this reprository keep in mined the following:

1.Dont forget to add comments to the code.

2.If its a big code split it into multiple files as we want to keep it fast.

# The Future of This project:

1.I want to keep it fast
2.In future after all the base code is written we will try to convert this in real A.i using artificial inteligence, machine learning .deep learning .
